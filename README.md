# RNN_Assn_Stock_Price_Pred
# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data fromfour companies: IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). We usefour different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology. Using data from allfour companies may improve the performance of the model. This way, we can capture the broadermarket sentiment.The problem statement for this assignment can be summarised as follows:"Given the stock prices of Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft for a set number of days, predictthe stock price of these companies after that window."

# Business Value
Data related to stock markets lends itself well to modelling using RNNs due to its sequential nature.We can keep track of opening prices, closing prices, highest prices, and so on for a long period oftime as these values are generated every working day.The patterns observed in this data can then be used to predict the future direction in which stockprices are expected to move. Analysing this data can be interesting in itself, but it also has a financialincentive as accurate predictions can lead to massive profits.
